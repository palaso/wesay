    Added a new environment variable for Linux (WESAY_INIT_XULRUNNER)
    which controls whether XulRunner is initialized on startup.  By
    default, it is initialized.  Turn off XulRunner initialization by
    setting the environment variable to 0.  If WESAY_USE_GECKO=1, then
    XulRunner is still initialized.

   - Improve list view functionality when the word field is empty and an
     alternate form is used instead.
